#### Pokemon
In the game, agents can visit shops, train their Pok√©mon at the gym, and interact with one another. As a player, you take on the role of an agent and can engage with others at any time. There are 6 characters in the Pok√©mon environment who appeared in Pokemon Emerald: [May](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/May_(game)), [Professor Birch](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Professor_Birch), [Steven Stone](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Steven_Stone), [Maxie](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Maxie), [Archie](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Archie) and [Joseph](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Mr._Stone). 

To launch the Pokemon game, first launch a local server with the following command:
```bash
uvicorn pokemon_server:app --reload --port 10002
```
Then open another terminal in the project's root path and run the following command:
```bash
cd ui
# If you do not have npm installed, you need to install it before running the following commands 
# https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm
# We have tested on npm@9.6.4, node@20.0.0
npm install
npm run watch
```
Wait for the compilation to complete, and have fun! (WASD for moving around, and SPACE for launching a conversation.)

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Installation

```bash
pip install -U agentverse
```
Or you can install the package by manually cloning the latest repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/OpenBMB/AgentVerse.git --depth 1
cd AgentVerse
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Some users have reported problems installing the `orjson` required by `gradio`. One simple workaround is to install it with Anaconda `conda install -c conda-forge orjson`.

You also need to export your OpenAI API key as follows
```bash
# Export your OpenAI API key
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
```

If you want to use the tools provided by BMTools, you need to install BMTools as follows:
```bash
git clone git+https://github.com/OpenBMB/BMTools.git
cd BMTools
pip install -r requirements.txt
python setup.py develop
```
